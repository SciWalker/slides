Marks of the children of God
1) we will obey his word - seek and thirst for his word - just like a child wants to know his father more -
2) humble and submit everything to to God 
3) depend on God through prayer - just like a son will talk to a father - will seek for father's assistance - matthew 7:11
4) our example reflect our Father - "like father like son" - not just our external behaviour - even our inner desire also reflect our father
5) love our brother and sister - we are family in christ - christ love church, so are we - love our enemies - just like Christ
6) even though he/she might fall into grave sin - yet he/she will not forever stay there - hebrew 12:6 god will discipline the one He love - God will remember his children - with his power, he will made everything for the benefit of his children - romans 8:28

Conclusion - examining one's self - as the children of God - we should reflect these marks - because these are very important - it concerns our eternal destiny - another hand - we are not perfect - but we strive for perfection - and God will always help us - and finally - it was grace and grace all along.... let's us live our identity as children of God out of gratitude and joy
