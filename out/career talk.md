2. MLOps
3. Automations
4. AI Model Deployment and Analytics

# 3. Advantages and Disadvantages of my Theoretical Physics Training in Tech Industry
## 3.1. Advantages of Research Background Applied to Tech(specific to general)

### A. Cross-domain Technical knowledge
Knowledge in physics & math is applicable to many fields, including:
- Fourier transform (image preprocessing, large language model)
- Linear algebra (tensor/vector calculation in neural networks)
- Probability theory (p-value and decision making)

### B. Cross-domain General Knowledge
- Occam razor (never extend a solution beyond what is necessary)
- First principle thinking
- Convex optimization (gradient descent)
- Scientific method (experiment, observation, hypothesis, conclusion)
- quantitative measures
- Modularity (mitochondrial ->separate of concerns)

### C. Capacity to think and communicate abstractly 
- reading and understanding technical papers
- writing design papers

### D. High level thinking and problem solving skills
- Systems thinking
- Tech industry is a fast-paced environment, and the ability to think in higher level and solve problems quickly is a must.
- Theoretical physicists can formulate hypotheses, test predictions, analyze data, draw conclusions, and propose new theories.
- They can also identify gaps in existing knowledge and explore new directions for research.

## 3.2 Disadvantages
- Need to learn some basics in tech: 
i. new programming language like Python, Rust
ii. project management 
iii. computer science
iv. domain knowledge etc.)
- Fast paced in tech industry might clash with the more deliberate pace of research
- Starting position limited to R&D fields (AI, NFC etc) or have to start from junior position
- might not go deep in any R&D field unless you work in a big company

# 4. What I learnt from my career in tech industry, and advices
- Be humble
- Be ambitious and seek to grab opportunities
- be willing to learn new things.
- be curious and willing to learn new things constantly; 
- seek feedback regularly and use it for improvement; network with other professionals in your field; 
- embrace challenges as opportunities for growth; 
- be flexible and open-minded
- enjoy what you are doing
- Be a good team player

# 5. Should you go to tech?
- Both research and tech industry offer good rewards as long as you work hard enough. 
- It depends on your personality and preference.
- Tech industry tends to be volatile, and qualities of company/team matters a lot.

# 6. Conclusion
It is possible for a research scientist switch career in tech industry. However, it is not easy. You need to be willing to learn new things, and be open to new opportunities.
