A. Introduction
B. Its nature
1. Old Testament usage:
● nãham = to grief, to lament, to be sorry
- Job 42:6 因此我厌恶自己，在尘土和炉灰中懊悔。
● sûb = turn back, change of direction
- negatively, turning away from their sin - 1 King 8:35 他们若向此处祷告，承认你的名，离开他们的罪 - Ezekiel 3:19 倘若你警戒恶人，他仍不转离罪恶
- positively, turning to the Lord - Psa 51:13  我就把你的道指教有过犯的人，罪人必归顺你 - Isa 10:21  所剩下的，就是雅各家所剩下的，必归回全能的神 - usually has promises attached to it when using it with positive sense, e.g. Isaiah 55 - if ppl repent, God will have mercy, will give abudantly, Ezekiel 33 - if ppl repent, God will let them live
- in OT, repentance is the matter of heart, it's not about some external act - Hos 6:6  我喜爱良善（或作：怜恤），不喜爱祭祀；喜爱认识神，胜於燔祭。 -
Joe 2:13  你们要撕裂心肠，不撕裂衣服。归向耶和华你们的神；因为他有恩典，有怜悯，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱，并且後悔不降所说的灾。  
- in OT, repentance also has element doing the right thing Jer 34:15  如今你们回转，行我眼中看为正的事
- in OT, repentance also has element of rejecting all form of ungodliness Jer 26:3  或者他们肯听从，各人回头离开恶道，使我後悔不将我因他们所行的恶，想要施行的灾祸降与他们。 
2. New Testament usage:
● metanoeõ μετανοέω, change one mind 
● epistrephõ ἐπιστρέφω - involves faith, turn around and believe
- the idea is changing your heart and mind - Matthew 4:16 耶稣就传起道来，说：「天国近了，你们应当悔改！」 - gives an impression of changing from old to a new man - from a heart of stone into heart of flesh, a mind of flesh into a mind of christ
- many ppl thought that repentance more mention in OT, but actually NT, jesus, paul, disciple, all started their message by repentance - until revelation, john also keep mentioning repent


C. Elements in repentance: A study of Psalm 51 - After Nathan rebuke David concerning of his sin - what standing between Nathan and David is the word of God - else David as a king could have killed Nathan with just 1 word - and here we can how word of God transform David and made him repent - from a schemer to a heart broken sinner coming before God - the story of the rich man taking away the poor man's sheep - this story shattered David's pride and made him knew what he have done before the Lord - then he wrote this psalm - we can see element of repentance in this psalm
1. Sorrowing over sin
Godly sorrow - a sorrow that allow one see sin in a new light - a real sight at sin - the seriousness of sin - god made us see sin in its true form, and it made us fly to christ desperately - over here we can see how David describes his sin - 1) 1b: "过犯" - transgression - rebel against authority - intentionally disobey 2) 2a: 罪孽 - iniquity - inward disposition, inward corruptions - or inwards evil plan in Micah 2:1 3) 2b: 罪 - sin - "missing the mark" - didn't reach the goal that God has set - thus, we can see that sin is not just an outward act, but sin comes from inside, our wicked evil motive, sin comes from our nature - we dont become sinners when we sin - we sin because we are sinners - in 51:5 iniquity also can mean sinful nature (here i wanna 不好意思 to esther about the question on psalm 103:3, because usually iniquity usually refers to our evil motive, our inner wickedness, but sometimes it also can refer to sinful nature in certain bible verse such as 51:5) - thus, when we sin, it is because we are sinners, we have a sinful nature that will make us has tendency towards evil - because we are in Adam, we inherit this from him - this is inherited even when we still in mother womb - (if you still remember what i said last week, that even if baby dies in infancy, even if he/she havent done any "actual sin", he is still a sinner, he/she still in Adam, this infant still need Jesus, he need to get regenerated in order for he/she to enter "in Christ") - thus it is very dangerous to say that infant get saved because he havent done "actual sin" - this is like saying one can get saved when he still "in adam", which bible clearly say ppl only saved when they are "in christ" - back to topic, not only we sin because we are sinners, the sins is a mutany, a rebel act against the king, it's a direct attack on God - many times ppl thought that sin is not good, because it cause harm to others or self etc, but in 51:4 David clearly say that he 惟独得罪了你 - when one truly repent, he knows that the heart of the sin problem is that he sinned against God - imagine when u take spear and try to pierce your king - this is what happen when u sin - this is a reminder to all preahers, that when we preach sin, we need to preach sin in its seriousness, its true form, its real horror - u need to let ur congregation see sin in this way - it is a treason to the God of most high - everytime we sin, we strike the holiness of God, the glory of God - 罪是对上帝正义的挑战，是对上帝怜悯的强暴，是对上帝耐心的嘲笑，是对上帝权力的轻视，是对上帝之爱的蔑视。- John Bunyan - a godly sorrow has clear object in sight, that is God
2. Confessing specific sin
- 51:14 No one likes charges of specific sin unto themselves - but when there is true repentance, they are willing to take up the charges
3. Forsaking sin
- 51:10 - a readiness to forsake sin - Pro 28:13  "承认离弃罪过的，必蒙怜恤" - it is not just an emotional rides - but changes of all dimension - the mind, the will and the emotion
4. Casting ourselves upon mercy - positive side of repentance - true repentance always has another positive side - the side that trust God, faith upon God - rely on God's mercy - 51:9,11,17 - those who cast themselves upon mercy will surely find mercy - this is the promise of God
5. Yearning for holiness
- 51:6,7 - longing for holiness
6. Serving others
- 51:13 - desire to serve others - once we tasted mercy, we will have desire for others to have it
7. Worshiping God
- all these will surely lead to worship God 51:15 - when there is true repentance, you will have joy 51:12, and the joy will surely lead u to worship God

Necessity of Repentance
1. Repent or perish: message to the unbeliever
-  must repent or perish Luke 13:5 你们若不悔改，都要如此灭亡 - true for everyone - even for people that are decent - because even we dont sin outwardly, there are many sin inside of us - not only tell them to repent, but urge them to repent now  2 Cor 6:2 看哪！现在正是悦纳的时候；现在正是拯救的日子
2. Repent lifelong: message to the believer
- often neglect - it is true that once saved, always saved - repentance not only once but repentance is also a life-long process - this is one of the core theme in 95 thesis by luther - something we should warn ourselves and others - life-long repentance very important for our christian growth and discipleship - Rom 12:2  不要效法这个世界，只要心意更新而变化，叫你们察验何为神的善良、纯全、可喜悦的旨意。- Mat 16:24  若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。 - therefore, sometimes it's very hard to separate repentance and sanctification - repentance is never finish until we see Christ - because we never perfect, we still sin, we still many things in our lives and our heart still fallen short of God's glory - so in what ways we can preach in their life-long repentance?
a. Vain thoughts
Jer 4:14 - many sinful thought 耶路撒冷啊，你当洗去心中的恶，使你可以得救。恶念存在你心里要到几时呢？- even sometimes when we devotion or pray - shows how wicked we are
b. Worldliness
James 4:4 你们这些淫乱的人（原文作淫妇）哪，岂不知与世俗为友就是与神为敌吗？所以凡想要与世俗为友的，就是与神为敌了。- as Christian we also many times become wordliness
c. Backslidings
- Rev 2:4  然而有一件事我要责备你，就是你把起初的爱心离弃了。 
d. Burying talents
- Luke 19:11-27 the parable of the ten minas
e. Ingratitude
- many times we not thanksful to our God...
f. Unbelief
- in times of trial...we show unbelief - we dont faithful to God during the times of trial - people are watching us, regardless unbeliever or believer

Motives and Encouragements to Repent
1. Consider our obligations to repent
Act 17:30  世人蒙昧无知的时候，神并不监察，如今却吩咐各处的人都要悔改 - the grace we received in covenant (the family we grew up, the baptism we received etc) should encourage us to repent 
2. Consider what sin is
- i have mentioned just now - another point can add - sin is momentarily pleasure, but long term suffering - Heb 11:25  他宁可和神的百姓同受苦害，也不愿暂时享受罪中之乐。e.g. fish hook
3. Consider what death is
- when you die, if u didn't repent - it is too late - no repentance in the grave
4. Consider the Judgment Day
Eze 22:14  到了我惩罚你的日子，你的心还能忍受吗？你的手还能有力吗？我耶和华说了这话，就必照著行。 
Act 17:30  世人蒙昧无知的时候，神并不监察，如今却吩咐各处的人都要悔改。 
Act 17:31  因为他已经定了日子，要藉著他所设立的人按公义审判天下，并且叫他从死里复活，给万人作可信的凭据。」 
- Saviour become Judge
5. Consider the sufferings of Christ
- when we see the suffering, we see the seriousness of sin, and the greatness of our God's love to us
6. Consider injuries done to God
- we rebels, we despise his son, we grieved his spirit despite how much he loves us
7. Consider the spiritual blessings that repentance brings
- repentance can be consider a channel, as we repent, it makes us humble, he made us imitate christ, follow his way - through repentance we receive blessing from him...

Obstacles hindering repentance
1. Thoughtlessness
Jer 8:6  我留心听，听见他们说不正直的话。无人悔改恶行，说：我做的是什麽呢？他们各人转奔己路，如马直闯战场。 - they dont think, they just do what everyone does - 
2. Spiritual lethargy
- laziness Eph 5:14-16  所以主说：你这睡著的人当醒过来，从死里复活！基督就要光照你了。  你们要谨慎行事，不要像愚昧人，当像智慧人。 要爱惜光阴，因为现今的世代邪恶。 
3. Negative views of true religion and repentance
- some ppl think repentance is very sad, not profitable, very embarassing - some ppl feel that we shouldn't be so religious, no need to take so seriously - no need to repent life-long etc - 1Ti 4:8  「操练身体，益处还少；惟独敬虔，凡事都有益处，因有今生和来生的应许。」 - some think lightly about sin - some youngster feel that this thing very "old fashioned" - which one important? how ppl see you or how god see you
4. Love and cares of the world
- Luk 8:14  那落在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，走开以後，被今生的思虑、钱财、宴乐挤住了，便结不出成熟的子粒来。 - too love the world, until a point they forgot about their soul...until death comes
5. Presumption
- Deu 29:19  听见这咒诅的话，心里仍是自夸说：『我虽然行事心里顽梗，连累众人，却还是平安。』 - a bit like covid huh? thinking going out without mask, no SOP, n presume they are safe - just like ppl in church, thinking they come to church, doing some church ministry, got offering, so they are safe - some ppl just put their assumption on God's attribute - especially mercy - well god is mercy, but he also just... - some ppl assume they are saved because they got peace feeling after pray, without knowing anything about repentance - or god answer their prayer etc..
6. Fatalism
- there is no hope - because if im not elect, then im not saved - some ppl say i got too much sin, god wouldnt forgive me - repentance is a good thing, despair is the bad thing - because despair rejects mercy
7. Delay
- the most prominent reason for not repenting - "now i'm too busy, maybe later" - from young, to middle age, to old age - and that time, it's too late - for this kind of ppl, we just simply need to warn them - and remind them that we do not know what happen next moment - not only so, opportunity God gave has time limit - Rev 2:21  我曾给他悔改的机会，他却不肯悔改他的淫行。 

Fruits of repentance
1. Righting wrongs
- you will have desire to make right on your wrong doing - e.g. apologize, repay the debts etc.. - e.g. zachaeus - 
2. Indignation against sin, Satan, and sinful self
Psa 97:10  你们爱耶和华的，都当恨恶罪恶
- truly hate sin, n even ourselves, because of our sinful nature
3. Godly fear
- he fear God, and also fear of his own sin
4. Vehement desire for righteousness
- he wants to live righteously
5. Watchfulness against sin
- they more sensitive even to the tiny sin
6. Zeal for God
- as they knew the grace and mercy of God, as they repent, it made the believers bold, courageous, consumed for God's glory

Practical conclusions for preaching repentance
1. How to distinguish true and false repentance
- Thomas Watson - should read - counterfeit repentance - thinking he can do works to ammend his wrong doing and get saved - true repentance is knowing he cant do anything other than run to christ for his mercy - counterfeit repentance - fear of judgement, fear of what others think, fear of the bad consequence of sin - true repentance - fear of God, understand he sin alone to God, it's ultimately sinned against God - counterfeit - focus on big sin that can be seen - true - focus on sin that is inside - counterfeit - flow from pride - true - flow from love - etc etc, want learn more can read thomas watson
2. Allow for degrees in repentance
varies from person to person - Bavinck say, repentance, though source is the same, but comes with different form - the unity and the diversity - even bible figures, from ot to nt, everyone repentance is different experiences
3. Stress the “gift character” of repentance
- repentance is the gift of God - Psa 85:4  拯救我们的神啊，求你使我们回转，叫你的恼恨向我们止息。 - 神且用右手将他高举（或作：他就是神高举在自己的右边），叫他作君王，作救主，将悔改的心和赦罪的恩赐给以色列人。 

Word Study

NT
πιστις, πιστευω  = trust in, believe in, combined both words, NT uses more than 500 times, emphasizing how importance faith is for christianity - trust in, believe in - not shallow "believe", but leaning on, trusting our lives to, a firm conviction - it's has a very deep meaning

Scriptural Usage
1. Old Testament
- Genesis 3:15 我又要叫你和女人彼此为仇；你的後裔和女人的後裔也彼此为仇。女人的後裔要伤你的头；你要伤他的脚跟。- the protoevangelium - first revelation of the covenant of grace - and the result - Adam named his wife, eve, the mother of living 众生之母- this is the result of his belief - (extra note, Adam is saved, not only he believes, he is the recipient of God's covenant)

- Matthew 11:28 凡劳苦担重担的人可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息。- jesus asking faith to his person
- John - uses faith more than 100 times - and if u notice how John use the word "faith" - almost always refer to saving faith, not miraclous faith etc - the best example 3:16 - moreover john uses faith as 1) coming to christ John 6:36-37 你们已经看见我，还是不信, 凡父所赐给我的人必到我这里来 2) eating of christ John 6:51 我是从天上降下来生命的粮；人若吃这粮，就必永远活著 3) drinking of christ John 4:14 人若喝我所赐的水就永远不渴 5) abiding in christ John 15:5 我是葡萄树，你们是枝子。常在我里面的，我也常在他里面 - these are just some examples, but u can see, the meaning of faith is too rich in NT, it is very hard to give a short definition
- Paul: "justify by faith alone" "united with christ by faith" "faith expressed in godly living - Hebrews: heroes of faith, where it shows the faith is the one help us endure till the end - James "faith without works is dead" - Peter "faith and hope in God" - unity: salvation is obtained by faith in Christ

Definition
- As mentioned just now, the meaning of faith in bible is too rich - let us see how others define faith - 海德堡要理问答21 - 什么是真信心？真信心不仅是一种确实的知识，藉此我认定上帝在圣经中向我们所启示的一切皆为真理；也是一种坚定的信靠，是由圣灵通过福音在我里面做成的工作；使我确信，唯独出于上帝的恩典，唯独因基督的功德，就白白地将赦罪及永远的公义和拯救，不仅赐给别人，也赐给了我。- 西敏小要理问答 86 什么是信耶稣基督？信耶稣基督是一种与救恩相伴的美德，藉此使我们照福音所显明的基督接待祂，并惟独靠祂得救 - this is a very concise definition - Brakel - 信心就是对基督衷心信靠，并藉着基督对上帝衷心信靠，从而称义、成圣、得荣。信心所依靠的是基督的自愿舍己，并根据祂的应许，祂必会为所有接受祂、倚靠祂称义、成圣并得荣的人成就这一切。- as result of richness of the meaning of faith in bible, the definition also get alot variety throughout many authors - unity: receiving and relying on Christ alone for salvation 

The Object Of Faith
- these 2 element are actually the same, word became bible, word became flesh
1. The Bible as the Word of God
- how does faith respond to the word of God? - obedience, fear, conviction and believe, joy
2. The Person and work of Jesus Christ
- how does faith respond to the Person and work of Jesus Christ? worship, bow down, believe (prophet), trust in Him (priest), submission (king)

Elements Of Faith
- According to bible, saving faith has 3 elements:
1. Knowledge (cognitio)
- we cannot say we believe in Christ but without any knowledge of Christ - Joh 17:3  认识你独一的真神，并且认识你所差来的耶稣基督，这就是永生 - Joh 1:18  从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将他表明出来 - "表明" in original greek means exegesis - which obviously mean to explain - which clearly says that Jesus is the exegesis of God - Jesus made God clearly known to us - Mat 11:27  一切所有的，都是我父交付我的；除了父，没有人知道子；除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父 - the revelation by the father through the son, through faith give us the knowledge of God - knowledge is fundamental, all trust is based on knowledge - u can't love someone you dunno - when comes to knowing/knowledge in biblical sense, it is not just you know someone, but this knowing/knowledge is a personal/intimate knowledge - in OT, Adam "knew" Eve, referring to both of them having sexual intercourse - this usage is not because Moses ran out of words, but this is how knowing was used at that time - knowing in Israelites culture has a very personal/intimate meaning in it - e.g. knowing God vs knowing about God - by JI parker
2. Assent (assensus)
- agreement - believing and agree on who he is
3. Trust (fiducia)
- confident, trusting Christ - surrending entire person to Lord Jesus Christ - the mind, the will, the soul - not trusting momentarily, but involve everything, our whole life - "deny yourself, bearing ur cross, follow me" - transfer all my reliance on anything to Christ alone

Faith’s Experiential Dimension - how faith operate in our soul, in our experience
1. Faith empties self of all its righteousness
- Psa 71:16  我要来说主耶和华大能的事；我单要提说你的公义 - when someone come into faith - he empty his own righteousness and trust Christ righteousness - implication: humbleness - faith will help one know he cannot depend in anything other than Christ and Christ only - so faith always realizing that it is not by our works, it is by Christ and his works
2. Faith wholeheartedly assents to the gospel
- 西敏大要理问答72 "使人称义的信心不仅赞同福音应许的真实性，而且接受并信靠福音所应许的基督和祂的义" - holding the gospel, as if it is the saving rope of our lives - a firm conviction, not just mind, but will and emotion
3. Faith closes with Christ
- Php 4:7  神所赐、出人意外的平安必在基督耶稣里保守你们的心怀意念 - experience joy and peace with Christ - faith can unite us with Christ, enable us to enjoy all spiritual gift in Christ - experience the close relationship with Christ
4. Faith lives out of Christ
- Gal 2:20 我已经与基督同钉十字架，现在活著的不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活著；并且我如今在肉身活著，是因信神的儿子而活；他是爱我，为我舍己 - being united with Christ by faith - believers possessed all Christ's benefits - and the believers can experience all these benefits in their daily life - that he/she can say what Paul said here - once a theologian say Christ outside of us is the ground of our justification, Christ inside of us is the fruit of our justification - faith is not something intellectual only, faith is also found in our experience, faith is the masterwheel of our christian life - without faith, there is no christian life

Saving Faith / Coming To Christ By Faith
1. What coming to Christ is not
- is not coming to church physically - e.g. lord's supper, raising hand during altar call etc.
- it is not purely mental act, not just believing the fact of Christianity - John 6:44 "若不是差我来的父吸引人，就没有能到我这里来的" - no man are able to come to Christ except the power of God - we need to acknowledge that coming to Christ by faith is ultimately God's act
- it is not an act of will by my own strength - ppl say "i decided to follow christ" - and doesnt acknowledge the work of the HS - Romans 9:16 据此看来，这不在乎那定意的，也不在乎那奔跑的，只在乎发怜悯的神
- our will by nature reject God Rom 8:7  原来体贴肉体的，就是与神为仇；因为不服神的律法，也是不能服
- it is not some mystical experience, unrelated to scripture - some charismatic claim they come to Christ, but know nothing about faith, nothing about repetance, some even know nothing about atonement - they thought they come to christ because of some feeling / experience
2. What coming to Christ is
a. Recognition of need for Christ
- Mat 11:28  凡劳苦担重担的人可以到我这里来，我就使你们得安息 - recognize the need of Christ, run to Christ - John 7:37 「人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝 - faith recognize the thirst, faith can made someone feel thirst that only can be cure by christ
b. Revelation of suitableness of Christ
- Joh 6:68  西门彼得回答说：「主啊，你有永生之道，我们还归从谁呢？ - recognizing there are things we need from Christ and Christ only - e.g. peace, eternal life, joy - and eventually a believer will recognize everything they need is Christ, and they can list them
c. Appropriation of Christ
- surrendering myself and my needs to him, trusting him will meet all my needs and be my savior
i. Active appropriation
- we come to christ, surrendering actively
ii. whole being appropriation
- we come to christ, surrendering wholly
iii. Exclusive appropriation
- we surrendering to Christ only, doesnt add anything else - because Act 4:12: 因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠著得救。- 西敏小要理问答 86 什么是信耶稣基督？信耶稣基督是一种与救恩相伴的美德，藉此使我们照福音所显明的基督接待祂，并"惟独"靠祂得救

Reasons for not coming
a. Ignorant of need
- don't realized the our need of christ, dont realized we are on the way to hell, don't realized the sinfulness of ourselves
b. Impenitent before Christ
- they unwilling to abandon the sin, love the world and himself too much - like the young rich ruler - 
c. delay
- presume they still got time, "tomorrow" - like when u trying to diet lol - but root problem i must say, it's unbelief
d. Extra-biblical revelation needed
- e.g. special experience etc
e. Resting in common convictions
- they have conviction from their childhood and they think this is faith
h. Wrong conception of God
- thinking God is fierce, must do something to make God accept him
i. “Making light” of Christ
- they think small about Christ
j. Not enough conviction of sin or “I’ve sinned too much”
- "that is why u need Christ" "you too sinful for Christ?"
l. “I have resisted the Spirit”
- if u still dont come to Christ, then u are resisting the spirit
m. “I’ve committed the unpardonable sin”
- the sins refer to those Jews at that time, ofc it still happens today, but it is still mystery in some areas - yet, if u worry about this, u probably not, those who do, they dont even care whether they commit or not
n. “I am unworthy”
- if u worthy, u no need to come to christ - it is precisely because u are not worthy, gospel is the grace of God - no one is worthy, question is, if u are not worthy, who shall u go to?
o. Unwillingness

Importance of Faith
1. Heart of relationship to God
- Rom 5:1  我们既因信称义，就藉著我们的主耶稣基督得与神相和。-  Rom 1:17 义人必因信得生 - faith is the status, the mode of existence of the new life -  2Co 5:7 因我们行事为人是凭著信心，不是凭著眼见。- without faith, we cant please God, we cant even have new life, we cant even have Christian life
2. Heart of life itself
- faith involves whole life - 1Co 10:31  所以，你们或吃或喝，无论做什麽，都要为荣耀神而行。 - faith involves in everything, everything we do, everything we think - reformed theologian always try to link faith with our lives, calvin - christian liberty, prayer, peace, hope, love, repentance, self denial - kuyper - every inch....
3. Heart of theology
- BB warfield - faith is the marrow of theology - true theology must have faith - we can't do true theology without faith - e.g. doctrine of inerrancy, systematic theology, hermeneutics etc
4. Heart of ordo salutis
- every one of the steps has a line linked to faith - regeneration produces faith, justification by faith, sanctification in faith etc etc.. - without faith we can't come before God - without faith we can't receive salvation from christ - without faith we can't walk with God at all
5. Heart of all the benefits of salvation
- by faith we received the HS Joh 7:38  信我的人就如经上所说：『从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。』」 - by faith we are children of God Joh 1:12  凡接待他的，就是信他名的人，他就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。 - our sin are forgiven Act 10:43  众先知也为他作见证说：『凡信他的人必因他的名得蒙赦罪。』」 - eternal life John 3:16 - christ indwellin in our heart Eph 3:17  使基督因你们的信，住在你们心里，叫你们的爱心有根有基， - the sealing of the HS Eph 1:13  你们既听见真理的道，就是那叫你们得救的福音，也信了基督，既然信他，就受了所应许的圣灵为印记。- we received the promises of Abraham Gal 3:14  这便叫亚伯拉罕的福，因基督耶稣可以临到外邦人，使我们因信得著所应许的圣灵。 - enter into rest Heb 4:3 但我们已经相信的人得以进入那安息，正如神所说：「我在怒中起誓说：『他们断不可进入我的安息！』」其实造物之工，从创世以来已经成全了。- stand on grace Rom 5:2  我们又藉著他，因信得进入现在所站的这恩典中，并且欢欢喜喜盼望神的荣耀。   


J. Forms Of Non-Saving Faith
1. Historical faith
- intellectual agreement - affirm and believe the doctrine and gospel - but somehow it doesn't impact life - Jas 2:19 鬼魔也信，却是战惊 - but those who has historical faith doesnt tremble - PS saving faith will always has element of historical faith in it - a true christian will always affirm and believe the gospel - when we talk about historical faith, we refering to groups of christian who only merely has historical faith - they believe the gospel, even believe the bible is the word of God, even accept and believe Christ - but totally has no interest on things of God at all - and no impact in their life - as if word of God doesn't become part of their life, part of their soul - word of God doesn't really serve anything to them - the word of God doesn't become the power for him - very common in church today - especially those who grew up in Christian family, they said they believe the bible but the word of God doesn't penetrate them - Matthew 7:24-27 好比一个无知的人，把房子盖在沙土上 - Jas 2:26  身体没有灵魂是死的，信心没有行为也是死的 - remind us to preach this message in our church
2. Temporary faith
- harder to distinguish compared to historical faith - because they show commitment, even emotionally - this idea if from Mat 13:20-21 撒在石头地上的，就是人听了道，当下欢喜领受， 只因心里没有根，不过是暂时的，及至为道遭了患难，或是受了逼迫，立刻就跌倒了 - this kind of faith goes further than historical faith - not only he believe the truth, he also applies them in their life - just like here say he received and rejoice - shows involvement even in emotion - problem: no deep root - lacking regenerated heart - they might even get very emotional - but when trial comes, they cant sustain, because no root - e.g. some ppl accept and later preach gospel everywhere, yet later leave christianity - temporary faith = how long? how temporary? - might be short might be very very long - usually these ppl very sincere, they not fake - but what they dont realize it's they do it ultimately for themselves, their well being - n when they realized what it takes, when they realized what they have to lose for this faith - they just quit - virgin girl waiting for groom - they excited, wanna enter, but they only concern themselves and not honoring the groom - totally different with saving faith - where it will want to serve God and others, motivated by love - 1 go in and 1 go out - temp faith no true humility because they focus themselves and dont realized who they are before God - but saving faith hate himself and cling to christ - also temp faith usually they receive certain things on christianity but not all - they probably take what is good for their life and ignore what is not good - whereas saving faith receive everything
3. Miraculous faith
- active vs passive - active: doer; passive: being done to - PS miraculous faith is possible to followed up by saving faith - peter, john vs judas - Mat 7:22-23 当那日必有许多人对我说：『主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名传道，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？』 我就明明的告诉他们说：『我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！』」 - passive: miracle being done to - doesnt always lead to saving faith

K. Practical Theological Issues
1. The “Lordship salvation” debate
- Zane C. Hodges vs John F. MacArthur - whether repentance from sin, obedience to God and submission to Christ Lordship are essential manner for sinner to be saved - the argument is that the addition of these things is not consistent with teaching of solo fide - Hodges think that faith is enough = believing saving facts about Jesus - Hodges: faith is the inward conviction that what God say to us in the gospel is true, this and this alone is saving faith - he uses samaritan women: jesus asks her to receive the water of life and nothing else - Macarthur mentioned 4 points: 1) gospel is a call to discipleship - jesus calls us to follow him and submit to him, not just make a decision or just make a prayer - 2) repentance is a critical element in saving faith - involves turning from evil to God - true faith never separate with true repentance - 3) faith is inseparable with obedience - faith is not just intellectual but personal commitment and trust (this is same like historical faith we mentioned) - merely knowing the facts is not the same as obedience - 4) one must confess Christ's lordship in order to be saved - Acts 2:21 到那时候，凡求告主名的，就必得救, 16:21 传我们罗马人所不可受不可行的规矩, Romans 10:9 你若口里认耶稣为主，心里信神叫他从死里复活，就必得救
2. Faith’s warrant
- what are our faith get grounded? what is foundation of our faith? - our faith is not blind faith 
a. The universal invitation of the gospel
- from OT to NT, God calls sinners to repent and invite them in his kingdom - our sins in some way made us hold on to Christ - not saying that we sin so that God can save us, or we sin so that grace appear more - this is not the meaning - this is from luther, when he talks to devil that he uses the weapon of devil to attack the devil - the weapon is sin, and sin makes away from Christ, but because of gospel, sin made luther run to Christ, holding firm on Christ - practical application - when we sin, many of us trying to hide from God, thinking we not worth etc - instead, we should run towards God
b. The command to believe in Christ
- believe in Him
c. The promise that faith will not fail
- the omnipotent of God
d. The all-sufficiency of Christ
- the most important - what he has done is enough
3. Difficulty of faith
- our sinful nature prone us to depend on ourselves - not trusting God - even though gospel is plain and simple - but we see so many ppl just unwilling to believe - in one way we should always preach faith's warrant, but not only this, as it will create a sort of easy believe system - also need to focus on ourselves, our sinful nature, our enmity with God
4. Faith and reason
- sometimes ppl say faith is a matter of reason - or say faith is very reasonable - but faith is not just reasonable, but faith is more than reasonable - Martyn Lloyd-Jones: supra-reason - if u believe that faith is reason - then we are saying that ppl can reason themselves into christianity - not true, our natural reason is fallen - faith is not unreasonable, or unrational, but transcend reason - faith is some ways, allowing ourselves to be directed and guided by the word of God, bible - faith able to recognize that are things too great for reason to understand, e.g. trinity etc - too great for reason, reason cannot grasp them, but faith can, faith able to recognize it's too great for reason but yet accept God's revelation by faith, then only we proceed to begin to understand it - I believe, therefore i understand

5. Faith as God’s gift
- Act 13:48  外邦人听见这话，就欢喜了，赞美神的道；凡预定得永生的人都信了 - faith is the result of divine ordination
- 1Co 12:3  所以我告诉你们，被神的灵感动的，没有说「耶稣是可咒诅」的；若不是被圣灵感动的，也没有能说「耶稣是主」 - faith is the fruit of the operation of the HS
- Joh 6:65  耶稣又说：「所以我对你们说过，若不是蒙我父的恩赐，没有人能到我这里来。」 - father enable us to come to jesus by faith 
- Heb 12:2  仰望为我们信心创始成终的耶稣 - jesus is the author of faith
- Eph 2:8 你们得救是本乎恩，也因著信；这并不是出於自己，乃是神所赐的；
6. Will there be faith in heaven?
- Heb 11:1  信就是所望之事的实底，是未见之事的确据 - so if u are in heaven, no need faith anymore, because you can see now? - however, faith has more meaning than this - as we seen earlier, the essence of faith is trust, reliance - if this is the case, we still have faith in heaven - in fact, our faith will reach the ultimatum in heaven - we will always 100% trust him - we will follow him whenever he goes - hence, if the meaning of faith is more than what we read in hebrew 11:1, when we take the overall meaning of faith throughout the bible, then faith doesn't stop in heaven

L. Conclusion
1. Warning to unbelievers: The wickedness and danger of
not believing in Christ - 1) if we reject, we are calling God a liar 1Jn 5:10  信神儿子的，就有这见证在他心里；不信神的，就是将神当作说谎的，因不信神为他儿子作的见证 - 2) rejection means you despise God, as if you despise someone who come to help us 3) rejection means you will be judged and go to hell - Mar 16:16  信而受洗的，必然得救；不信的，必被定罪。 
2. Encouragement to believers: Pursue increase in faith
- come to christ consistently - via different means, bible, prayer, trusting his promise
